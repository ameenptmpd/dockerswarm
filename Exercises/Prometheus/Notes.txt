Prometheus architecture

Prometheus server
	Data retriver
		pulls metrics data
	Time series database
		stores metrics data
	HTTP server 
		accepts PromQL queries 
	
Prometheus can monitor various services /targets like
	Linux/Windows server
	Apache server
	Single application
	Services like db
	etc
	
	
The units monitored within those targets can differ
	Linux/Windows server
		cpu, memory, disk utilization
		etc
	Apache server
		exception count, request count, request duration etc.
	Single application
	Services like db

Human readable metrics are generated out of it
	Metrics entries has
		type 
			3 metrics types
				counter
					e.g. number of container running
				gauge
					current status of some value
					e.g. 
					cpu utlization
					memory utilization
				histogram
					how long or how big
					
		help 
			description of the metrics
			
	
Data retriver worker
	pulls data over http 
		from http://host-address/metrics endpoint
	Each target should 
		have /metrics endpoint
		must be in correct format prometheus understands
Exporter
	For services which doesn't support "/metrics" endpoint
	collects data 
	converts it into a prometheus specific format
	exposes it on "/metrics" endpoint
	list of exporters already available for 
		mysql
		linux servers
		cloud platforms
		etc.
		list can be found at https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/
