docker node ls
	
2. Promote one of the worker node as manager

	docker node inspect --pretty <node>
	
	docker node promote <hostname from docker node ls>
	
	docker node ls
		This node would now be promoted to Reachable.
		
	In real production have atleast 3 managers.
	
	
3. 	
	docker node demote <Node>
	

4. docker node update --availability drain <Node>

5. docker node update --availability active <Node>

N.B: drain strategy can be used for Converting Docker Manager like Kubernetes Manager
		which doesn't entertain normal containers.
